# **STEAK SAUCE**
### *An organizational program for creating and prioritizing to-do lists*

Steak Sauce is a program designed to help create and prioritize to-do lists. It is based off of the common method of organizing to-do list by giving every list item a letter (A, B, C) and a number (A1[^1], A2, A3) to organize and prioritize your to-do lists.
